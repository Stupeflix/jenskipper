Jobs
====

The ``jobs.yaml`` file at the root of the repository maps the files in the
``templates/`` directory to actual Jenkins jobs. It is a mapping with the job
names as top level keys. Each entry is itself a mapping with the following
keys:

template
    Required, the name of the template to render in the ``templates/``
    directory.

default_context:
    Name of a context in ``contexts.yaml`` to pass to the template. If
    unspecified, defaults to ``default``.

context
    Optional, a mapping containing extra context overriding
    ``default_context``.

Extra jobs can be defined in the ``extra-jobs.yaml`` file. This can be
useful in scenarios where jobs are generated by external tools.
